# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This is research code. We do not guarantee long-term security support. The latest `main` branch receives best-effort fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please open a private issue or reach out via a placeholder contact (convert the issue to private if necessary). Do not publicly disclose until we have had a reasonable chance to investigate.

If a private channel is required, maintainers can provide contact details after an initial GitHub issue is filed.
